The a,b,c,d are supposed to give the directions for the sigma1 and sigma2, so (1,0,0,-1) just says the first sigma1 is wrt to the x-axis and the sigma2 is wrt the -y axis.  The sigmas of 2 and 1 make the fin shape. 
The xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax just set the scale of the filter: try [-3,3] for both or [-5,5]. 

To get the other orientations, I suggested that you just use imrotate: 

  B = CS5320_bar(1,0,0,-1); 
  B45 = imrotate(B,45,'crop');
  
  
  
  	
I think I've said this several times in class, but here are some things to do when writing requested functions:
 
  * follow the specification in the header (e.g., for input/output args and for their types)
  * do not read or load files from inside a function
  * do not plot or write from inside a function (unless that's part of its definition)
  * functions are to be runnable as given in the calling sequence in the header
  * when handin in your files, submit all files required to run the functions.
  
  
  
  
  We will be using the function located at:

High-level: Look at p. 171, it describes in Figure 6.7 what you need to do for each texture feature (it shows 2 of the bar filters).  So, implement Alg. 6.1 (texture_params), and then implement the "Build a Dictionary" part of Alg. 6.2 (kmeans_texture). For the latter, you don't need to implement a kmeans algorithm; you need to implement a function that takes a texture parameter image and runs it through the Matlab kmeans function.
Also, when calling the oriented Gaussian function, it will return a large window - that must be reduced (imresize) to a say 11x11.  If you look at the parameter feature images, you can see if the response is at the correct scale for the textures.
