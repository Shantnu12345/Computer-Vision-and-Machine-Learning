# Computer-Vision-and-Machine-Learning
This repository contains projects pursued by me in the area of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I would like to share my learnings via this repository with everyone.

First, this repository contains all the projects of Udacity Term 1. Please see UdacityTerm1 folder for that. Udacity students (or others) may refer this repository as a supplemnental material. Several concepts have been covered like Hough Transform, Color spaces, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, bounding boxes, Behaviorial Cloning, and TensorFlow & Keras.

Second, this repository contains Computer Vision basics projects that were part of CS6320 class at the University of Utah. Please see folder CVBasics for that. These projects give insightful knowledge about basic computer vision concepts like Camera Calibrartion, Edge Detector, Hough Transform, Segmentation, Kalman Filter Tracking, and Normalized coreelation to objects in an image. I have included the problem statement for each of the projects by the name Ai_homework (i is the project number), and the coreesponding result analysis and the theretical concepts are expalined in the folder named Ai (i is the project number)


Third, it contains the courese on SLAM by Claus Brenner


Please feel free to contact me if you find any problems in learning from this material.
